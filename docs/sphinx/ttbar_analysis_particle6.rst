Impact of methodological uncertainties
======================================================================================
Figure 5.9 of :cite:`ML4EFT_temp_id`.

Pair-wise 68% CL contours for the Wilson coefficients entering top quark pair production in the dilepton final state. 


We compare the bounds obtained by calculating the median across the :math:`N_{\rm rep}` 
MC replicas used in training with those obtained by taking into account the 
impact of the 1-:math:`\sigma` methodological uncertainties. 
Both ML models are trained on the full set of 18 kinematic features relevant for 
particle level top quark pair production in the dilepton final state.
