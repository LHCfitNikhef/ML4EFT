Impact of methodological uncertainties
=========================================================================================================

Figure 5.10 of :cite:`ML4EFT_temp_id`.

Pair-wise 95% CL contours for the Wilson coefficients entering :math:`hZ` production in the dilepton channel.


We compare the bounds obtained by calculating the median across the :math:`N_{\rm rep}`
MC replicas used in training with those obtained by taking into account the
impact of the 2-:math:`\sigma` methodological uncertainties.
Both ML models are trained on the full set of 7 kinematic features relevant for
particle level Higgs production in association with a :math:`Z` boson in the dilepton channel.
