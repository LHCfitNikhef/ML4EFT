	* VERSION:
	* NEWS:
	prepared for release 2.0.3

	* EEHelpers.hh ->  LundEEHelpers.hh:
	EEHelpers.hh was not being installed; given that it's a potentially 
	common name, renamed it before including among the installation 
	targets. 

	Also placed whole contents in a new contrib::lund_plane namespace,
	because of certain potentially common names like cross_product

	* Makefile:
	replaced EEHelpers.hh ->  LundEEHelpers.hh and made sure that
	LundEEHelpers.hh gets installed (without which RecursiveLundEEGenerator.hh
	cannot be used)

	* example_dpsi_collinear.cc:
	* example_dpsi_slice.cc:
	use of things from LundEEHelpers.hh updated to use of new namespace

	* RecursiveLundEEGenerator.hh:
	* RecursiveLundEEGenerator.cc:
	updated to use LundEEHelpers.hh (and associated namespace); 
	also added a (protected) default constructor to LundEEDeclustering
