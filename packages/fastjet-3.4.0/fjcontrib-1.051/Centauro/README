Implementation of the Centauro jet algorithm (described in "Asymmetric jet clustering in deep-inelastic scattering" by Miguel Arratia, Yiannis Makris, Duff Neill, Felix Ringer, Nobuo Sato, arXiv:2006.10751) using the FastJet contrib classes.

The Centauro jet algorithm is intended to be used in deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) and is suited for the family of frames connected to the Breit frame by longitudinal boosts. Its distance measure accounts for the forward-backward asymmetry in the Breit frame. It is longitudinally invariant and can cluster jets with Born kinematics, which enables novel studies of TMD observables.
