JetCleanser is part of the fastjet-contrib project.

   The JetCleanser class allows one to cleanse a jet as described in
   
      Jet Cleansing: Pileup Removal at High Luminosity
      David Krohn, Matthew Low, Matthew D. Schwartz, and Lian-Tao Wang.

   The code example.cc illustrates how to use the class in a simple case.
   
      make example
   
   example.cc makes use of an input datafile which is provided in the
   /data directory, and it should be run with
   
      ./example < ../data/Pythia-Zp2jets-lhc-pileup-1ev.dat
    
   The expected output can be found in example.ref


******************************************************
   Warning:
    If the jet constituents passed to JetCleanser are associated with a ClusterSequence, only the jet
    and subjets will be resaled, not the constituents themselves.  Thus jet pt and jet mass will be
    "cleansed", but general shapes, like N-Subjettiness", will not be.  This can be fixed by passing
    JetCleanser a jet that is not associated to a ClusterSequence or by commenting out line 402 and
    uncommenting lines 403-406 in JetCleanser.cc


******************************************************
   Not currently supported (but may be added in the future):
      - areas after cleansing
      - information whether linear defaulted to JVF or not
