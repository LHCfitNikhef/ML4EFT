The ClusteringVetoPlugin package is based on the physics described in:

   Vetoed jet clustering: The mass-jump algorithm
   Martin Stoll
   arXiv:1410.4637

It implements a terminating clustering veto in the sense that if a recombination
step is vetoed, both jets do not further participate in jet clustering
("terminating veto").
The default veto function is the mass-jump veto as described in the paper. Any
other veto function that takes two jets as arguments can be defined by the user.

Usage is illustrated in example.cc.
