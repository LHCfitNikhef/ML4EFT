-- 1.0.0:      Release of version 1.0.0. Changed order in which different functions are presented in example_basic_usage, for clarity.
-- 1.0-beta5:  Fixed bug about initialization of variables in ParticleStorage. Storage classes defined in separate header/source for clarity. Two example 		       files. One shows basic usage and one more advanced usage.
-- 1.0-beta4:  Mass infomation is now calculated/cached only if requested and not by default. This further reduces computation time.
-- 1.0-beta3:  Some classes renamed for clarity.  Critical information about single particles is now cached to reduce computation time.
-- 1.0-beta2:  Updated method for identify jets
