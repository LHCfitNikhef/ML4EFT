<chapter name="Update History"> 
 
<h2>Update History</h2> 
 
These update notes describe major updates relative to the 
PYTHIA 8.243 version, which was the starting point for PYTHIA 
8.3. The step from 8.2 to 8.3 gave an occasion to break backwards 
compatibility. The main change is that C++11 is now assumed. 
The impact on existing used code should be mild, however. 
 
<h3>8.308: 16 November 2022</h3> 
 
<ul> 
<li>The <code>HIInfo</code> class now has information about the impact 
parameter angle between colliding nuclei in the <code>phi()</code> 
function. In addition the impact parameter positions of the incoming 
nuclei are now set properly in <code>Particle::vProd()</code>.</li> 
 
<li>A new <code>PythiaCascade</code> wrapper class (in 
<code>include/Pythia8Plugins</code>) implements the functionality to 
perform fixed-target hadron-nucleus collisions and decays, as useful 
for the tracking of cascades is the atmosphere or in solid materials. 
The code in this class now is set up to handle any target nucleus. The 
new <code>main184.cc</code> example shows how to use 
<code>PythiaCascade</code> to track an atmospheric cascade, equivalent 
to the standalone <code>main183.cc</code>. An even simpler new example 
is found in <code>main185.cc</code>.</li> 
 
<li>The option to completely forbid popcorn baryon production from the 
beam remnant has been replaced by the possibility of a continuous 
suppression, see <code>BeamRemnants:dampPopcorn</code>.</li> 
 
<li> A new option for Pomeron flux has been added to provide more 
flexibility to modify the shape of the flux.</li> 
 
<li> Modified handling for resolved-lepton remnants so that also 
lepton-lepton collisions with unequal masses are correctly dealt with.</li> 
 
<li>Explicit bookkeeping of Hidden Valley (HV) colours in <b>SU(N)</b> 
scenarios has been introduced. These colours can be accessed in the 
event record, but are not shown by default. This allows for a more 
robust tracking of HV colours in showers. Notaby a Higgs decay to a 
pair of HV gluons can now be handled, which used to be impossible. 
The functionality of the <code>TimeShower:recoilToColoured</code> 
switch is extended also to apply to the HV colours.</li> 
 
<li>Update to decay method of <code>ParticleDecays</code> class allows 
for proper showering of leptons produced in Hidden Valley particle 
decays.</li> 
 
<li>A simple example of Hidden Valley production mechanisms introduced 
with <code>main171.cc</code>.</li> 
 
<li>Fixed a bug that could block the radiation of HV photons in a 
broken <b>U(1)</b> scenario, i.e. where the HV photons acquire mass. 
Affected was radiation in the decay of <ei>Fv</ei> states, i.e. states 
with a charge both in the normal and in the HV sector.</li> 
 
<li>Two new ROOT-based example programs, <code>main94.cc</code> and 
<code>main95.cc</code>, illustrating how to visualize events and jets, 
respectively, in <ei>(y, phi)</ei>-space. Thanks to D. Gillberg for 
contributing these examples.</li> 
 
<li>Added handling of statistical uncertainties to the 
<code>Hist</code> class, with error propagation in the various 
histogram operations and friend methods, for both unweighted and 
weighted events. Updated <code>Hist</code> compatibility for current 
Matplotlib.</li> 
 
<li>Updated JetMatching to support improved treatment of non-enhanced 
jets in FxFx merging, see <aloc href="JetMatching">Jet Merging</aloc> 
for more details. The updated treatment also fixes a bug that led to 
an asymmetric treatment of heavy quarks and the corresponding 
anti-quarks. Thanks to Rikkert Frederix.</li> 
 
<li>Vincia's tune initialisation has been changed to not override 
initialization, event-generation, statistics, and main-program 
settings.</li> 
 
<li>Included particle ID code in error message when a workable decay 
channel cannot be found in 
<code>ParticleDecays::decay()</code>. Thanks to K. Pedro for 
suggesting this.</li> 
 
<li>Added additional protection for Pythia intialization.</li> 
 
<li>Fixed an issue in the <ei>tau</ei> decays which caused 
segmentation faults when a <ei>tau nu</ei> final state is present in 
the event record without a mother <ei>W</ei>. Thanks to S. Jeon for 
reporting the problem.</li> 
 
<li>Corrected several typos in <code>antiName</code> and 
<code>chargeType</code> properties for particle ID codes for 
diffractive states (e.g., 9904230) in <code>ParticleData.xml</code>; 
thanks to A. Verbytskyi, G. Panizzo, and D. Konstantinov.</li> 
 
<li>Updated default top quark mass to 173 GeV (up from 171 GeV) in 
line with current PDG average (rounded to nearest GeV). Added particle 
data for a few more nuclei.</li> 
 
<li>Corrected a bug that affected the read-in of RPV couplings via 
SLHA files. In the erroneous version, a coupling for the third 
generation in the first index (i.e. 3,i,j) could not be set.</li> 
 
<li>Fixed bug preventing the generation of Python bindings in 
MacOS. Also fixed external library issue with Makefiles for 
MacOS.</li> 
 
<li>Updated <code>WeightsBase::getWeightNames</code> to provide RIVET 
compatible names.</li> 
 
<li>Updating HTML manual and program banner with new manual 
reference.</li> 
 
<li>Updating affiliation for Christian Bierlich.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<h3>8.307: 25 February 2022</h3> 
 
<ul> 
<li>New option with interpolation between the low-energy hadronic 
cross sections, used for rescattering, and the more traditional 
SaS/DL cross sections, used at high energies. The latter framework 
has also been extended to include many more collinding hadron 
pairs. The <code>Pythia::getSigmaTotal</code> and 
<code>Pythia::getSigmaPartial</code> methods give the user direct 
access to these cross sections. These extend and replace the 
<code>Pythia::getLowEnergySigma</code> methods. See further on 
<aloc href="TotalCrossSections">Total Cross Sections</aloc>.</li> 
 
<li>New "SU21" PDFs for some 20 mesons and baryons, to be used e.g. 
in the MPI scenarios in hadron-hadron collisions, e.g. in a cascade 
in the atmosphere. The <ei>pi+</ei> default PDF has been upgraded 
from GRV92 LO to GRS99 LO. The GJR07 LO set has been included as an 
option for the proton. The default value of 
<code>BeamRemnants:maxValQuark</code> has been updated to allow also 
charm and bottom hadrons as incoming beam particles.</li> 
 
<li>The framework for changing the beam kinematics between subsequent 
<code>Pythia::next</code> calls when using variable collision energies 
has been expanded. The <code>Pythia::setKinematics</code> methods 
mirror the frame type options for the beams. See further on 
<aloc href="ProgramFlow">Program Flow</aloc> and 
<aloc href="BeamParameters">Beam Parameters</aloc>.</li> 
 
<li>As a further extension of the above, a new option exists wherein 
the first beam particle is initialized so it can be switched 
event-by-event between essentially any incoming hadron, while the 
second beam is restricted to be a proton or neutron. Again only 
<code>SoftQCD</code> and <code>LowEnergyQCD</code> processes are 
possible. To handle this feature, the code has been extended so that 
some 20 different PDFs are initialized, each with a corresponding MPI 
initialization and storage of required coefficients. See further 
<aloc href="BeamParameters">Beam Parameters</aloc>.</li> 
 
<li>Extended and improved handling of the Hidden Valley (HV) scenario. 
<ul> 
<li>Improved tracing of hidden-valley colours through a hidden-valley shower 
evolution history, thereby avoiding problems for some topologies.</li> 
<li>Introduced the possibility to bookkeep individual HV hadron types, 
in particular HV-mesons, and thereby manange masses and decay 
properties. The default remains the simpler scheme, where only a smaller set 
of HV-hadron properties need to be defined. The detailed scenario also 
involves a mass-dependent handling of the joining of hadronization chains, 
or the collapse into a single hadron.</li> 
<li>The list of Zv decays has been expanded to include further HV-quarks. 
Some default masses have been modified.</li> 
<li>It is possible to set different production rates for HV-quarks during 
hadronization, and for HV-diquarks leading to HV-baryon production.</li> 
<li>Introduced an option to suppress production of one flavour-diagonal 
pseudoscalar state, representing the <ei>eta_1</ei> flavour singlet.</li> 
<li>The <code>HiddenValley:spinFv</code> default value has been changed 
from 1 to 0, to make it transparent that HV-quarks have spin 1/2 by 
default.</li> 
<li>Expanded the list of invisible particles accordingly.</li> 
<li>A few minor bug fixes.</li> 
<li>A significantly expanded description in 
<aloc href="HiddenValleyProcesses">Hidden Valley Processes</aloc>.</li> 
</ul> 
Thanks to Matt Strassler and Suchita Kulkarni for useful input.</li> 
 
<li>Added a new class <code>PythiaParallel</code> for easily making runs 
in parallel. See main161, main162 and main163 for usage examples. NOTE: this 
is an experimental feature. Feedback and bug reports should be sent to 
authors@pythia.org.</li> 
 
<li>New option introduced, where MPI initialization data can be stored 
on file and reused in a later run, to save time. See further on 
<code>MultipartonInteractions:reuseInit</code> and 
<code>MultipartonInteractions:initFile</code>. Also option to 
symmetrize the MPI rate between e.g. <ei>pi^+ p</ei> and <ei>pi^- p</ei>, 
see <code>MultipartonInteractions:setAntiSame</code>.</li> 
 
<li>New options allow a harder fragmentation function for a 
beam-remnant diquark, by a separate choice of the <ei>a</ei> and <ei>b</ei> 
parameters, and also forbid the popcorn mechanism for it. See further 
<aloc href="BeamRemnants">Beam Remnants</aloc>.</li> 
 
<li>New diffractive states introduced, to cover all five-flavour 
mesonic states, and all baryonic ones with at most one <ei>c</ei> or 
<ei>b</ei> quarks. Furthermore, nitrogen and oxygen have been added to 
the set of nuclei</li> 
 
<li>New processes <code>SoftQCD:singleDiffractiveXB</code> and 
<code>SoftQCD:singleDiffractiveAX</code> allow to set single 
diffraction to occur only by <ei>A B &rarr; X B</ei> or only by 
<ei>A B &rarr; A X</ei>.</li> 
 
<li>Reorganised and consolidated the interface to external matrix element 
generators. Renamed <code>ShowerMEs</code> to <code>ExternalMEs</code> and 
<code>ShowerMEsMadgraph</code> to <code>ExternalMEsMadgraph</code>. 
Introduced new <code>HelicitySampler</code> class to sample helicities 
using external matrix elements.</li> 
 
<li>New options to get and set the state of the random number generator, 
<code>Rndm::getState</code> and <code>Rndm::setState</code>, as a 
direct-transfer option to the file-based <code>dumpState/readState</code> 
methods.</li> 
 
<li>New methods <code>Hist::fillTable</code> to read back in a table 
of histogram data, specifically as written by the <code>Hist::table</code> 
methods.</li> 
 
<li>Some minor rearrangements in <code>HadronLevel</code> to better 
structure the interleaving of hadronic rescattering and particle 
decays. New method <code>Pythia::moreDecays(int i)</code> to perform 
the decay of a single specified particle.</li> 
 
<li>Switched tunes to by default prefer LHAPDF 6 PDFs over LHAPDF 5 
ones, via the setting <code>Tune:preferLHAPDF</code>.</li> 
 
<li>New <code>LHAPDF:xSymmetric</code> parameters allow the user to 
choose to use symmetric PDFs for <ei>s</ei>, <ei>c</ei>, and 
<ei>b</ei> quarks when using LHAPDF for a performance boost. By 
default, <ei>c</ei> and <ei>b</ei> are taken as symmetric (this 
matches the previous behaviour).</li> 
 
<li><code>Info::pTnow()</code> can now also be used for showers during 
resonance decays, and when using the <code>shower()</code> method. The 
latter so far only for the Simple and Vincia shower models.</li> 
 
<li>Corrected a bug that mainly affects beam-remnant fragmentation in 
the QCD CR model. Previously, diquark-antidiquark systems with 
invariant masses below the threshold for baryon-antibaryon production 
would be combined into tetraquark-like states that do not exist in 
PYTHIA, resulting in errors with unknown particle codes and charge 
non-conservation. Now, 
<code>MiniStringFragmentation::ministring2two()</code> instead 
reconnects such topologies into two mesons, noting that this is 
consistent with the colour structure. Further motivation comes from 
studies of low-mass junction-antijunction systems in <ref>Sjo03</ref>. 
</li> 
 
<li>Introduced fix to prevent the central description of Les Houches 
events showered with global recoil from shifting when shower 
variations are enabled.</li> 
 
<li>Fixed a few issues in Vincia's sector merging. Specifically, 
while the merging itself still only handles QCD corrections, 
Vincia's QED showers can now be left on during merging. 
Also corrected a bug leading to incomplete histories replacing complete 
ones with smaller probability, and fixed an inconsistent treatment 
of trial showers in systems with coloured resonances.</li> 
 
<li>When running Angantyr at very low energies, initialization would 
abort due to an incorrect initialization of the high-mass diffraction 
MPI machinery. Logic has been introduced to prevent this 
initializatoin.</li> 
 
<li>Fixed memory leaks in the <code>ColourReconnection</code> class.</li> 
 
<li>Fixed some recent compiler warnings and errors; thanks to Mattias 
Ellert</li> 
 
<li>Removed the deprecated <code>SubCollisionModel</code> called 
<code>MultiRadial</code> from the heavy ion machinery.</li> 
 
<li>Added an abort in Pythia initialization to prevent using a low 
energy process with a hard process. Thanks to Jenna Bacon.</li> 
 
<li>Broke a circular shared pointer reference in 
<code>ResonanceWidths</code> and <code>ParticleDataEntry</code> which 
caused a small memory leak. Thanks to Gabriele Inghirami.</li> 
 
<li>Minor fix to avoid unnecessary (attempted) MPI initialization.</li> 
 
<li>Fixed issue with Dire getting stuck when showering soft QCD 
events. Note, Dire has not been validated for these types of 
events. Thanks to Giancarlo Panizzo and Marvin Flores for reporting 
the issue.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<h3>8.306: 28 June 2021</h3> 
 
<ul> 
<li>Introduced ability to write intermediate output with RIVET, as 
demonstrated in the updated <code>main93.cc</code>.</li> 
 
<li>Fixed the incorrect scale being set when applying the POWHEG veto, 
i.e. <code>main31.cc</code>. Note that the number of emissions is 
correct in 8.303, but is incorrect in 8.304 and 8.305. Thanks to 
Mikhail Kirsanov.</li> 
 
<li>Fixed repeated initialization causing an ever expanding physics 
pointer list in the main <code>Pythia</code> class.</li> 
 
<li>Fixed issue for HepMC output from Vincia, which would previously 
issue warnings about inconsistent mother/daughter relationships, 
caused by Vincia's antenna-style bookkeeping by which emitted partons 
have two mothers instead of one. For status codes 43, 51, and 53, the 
HepMC interface now ignores the second parent, always using just the 
first one to define the vertex structure. Minor modifications to 
Vincia's QCD shower to ensure that the first mother is the one that 
changed colour and hence would be identified with the "radiator" in a 
collinear context. Analogous modifications in the QED module so the 
most collinear parent is the first mother. 
</li> 
 
<li>Removed <code>assert</code> statements from Angantyr.</li> 
 
<li>Shortened Pythia constructor header.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<h3>8.305: 03 May 2021</h3> 
 
<ul> 
<li>Fixed issue that otherwise caused the weights of the Dire 
parton shower to be erroneously discarded. The fix will impact 
the results produced with the Dire parton shower model. The 
results of the previous version should be considered 
incorrect.</li> 
 
<li>Fixed potential for segfault in <code>Weights.cc</code> if 
<code>weightsShowerPtr == nullptr</code>.</li> 
 
<li> A number of fixes related to Vincia have been included. 
<ul> 
  <li>Bug fixes in Vincia's merging, addressing the issue that 
  occasionally incomplete histories were accepted while a complete one 
  was available.</li> 
  <li>Fixed some small bugs in Vincia's QED shower that could cause 
  issues when running at very high energies.</li> 
  <li>Minor namespace fixes. Moved <code>using namespace 
  VinciaConstants</code> from headers to source files and moved 
  <code>enum antFunType</code> inside the Pythia8 namespace.</li> 
  <li>Added default initialisers for data members in several Vincia 
  classes, to avoid potentially undefined behaviour. Thanks to 
  V. Zecca.</li> 
</ul> 
</li> 
 
<li>Fixed unintentional initial-state radiation from unresolved hadron 
beams when set with option <code>BeamRemnants:unresolvedHadron</code> 
which would break up the beam. Minor fix also for cases where two 
unresolved hadrons.</li> 
 
<li>Added threshold check on low energy cross sections. This fixes a 
small bug reported by Vittorio Zecca.</li> 
 
<li>Corrected bug in normalization of histograms in 
<code>main07.cc</code>. Thanks to M. Baker and A. Thamm.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<h3>8.304: 09 April 2021</h3> 
 
<ul> 
<li>Christian Preuss and Rob Verheyen join the author team.</li> 
 
<li>Christine O. Rasmussen leaves as an active author.</li> 
 
<li>New "sector" antenna showers implemented and made default 
for the Vincia antenna shower model.</li> 
 
<li>Minor changes to a few of the default Vincia hadronisation 
parameters, reflecting the move to sector showers as default.</li> 
 
<li>New dedicated LO merging scheme for the Vincia sector antenna 
showers. The scheme is similar to CKKWL in spirit but exploits the 
bijective nature of the sector shower to vastly reduce the number of 
histories that need to be taken into account.</li> 
 
<li>New full-fledged electroweak shower option implemented for the 
Vincia shower model. The splitting kernels are based on collinear 
limits of corresponding helicity matrix elements so this EW shower 
model requires Born partons with assigned helicities. Currently these 
must either be input via LHEF or (for experts) runtime via Vincia's 
interface to MG5 matrix elements.</li> 
 
<li>Introduced tools to automatically generate MadGraph plugin 
libraries.</li> 
 
<li>New options for interleaved resonance decays implemented for both 
Pythia's default (simple) shower model, and for Vincia's 
antenna-shower model. Made default for the Vincia shower model, 
while Pythia's shower keeps its previous (non-interleaved) default 
setting.</li> 
 
<li>Revised internal handling of shower variations and splitting 
enhancements, both for regular and trial emissions. Enhancements of 
rare shower splittings are now steered by settings instead of 
UserHooks, and the necessary weights are automatically included in the 
shower and merging weights.</li> 
 
<li> A number of updates have been made to sophisticated <ei>tau</ei> 
decays. 
<ul> 
  <li>External SPINUP is now always interpreted as a helicity state in 
  the lab frame to ensure consistent treatment between <ei>tau</ei> 
  decays and helicity showers.</li> 
  <li>The default external mode for tau decays has been changed to 
  handle helicity showers.</li> 
  <li><ei>gamma gamma &rarr; tau^+ tau^-</ei> processes are now 
  handled.</li> 
  <li>Helicity states for initial beams can be specified and used in 
  <ei>tau</ei> decays.</li> 
</ul> 
</li> 
 
<li>Added HDF5 support.</li> 
 
<li>Added support for lepton-photon initiated hard processes generated 
internally or externally. Thanks to Liu Yao-Bei.</li> 
 
<li>Minor code changes to allow hadronic rescattering in nuclear 
collisions (remove limit on number of rescatterings, increase maximum 
transverse vertex location).</li> 
 
<li>Double quarkonia production, if enabled, is now also included in 
both MPI and second hard processes.</li> 
 
<li>Added some new functionality to the <code>Hist</code> class.</li> 
 
<li>Moved the event information in Info class to an appropriate 
diffractive system for hard diffraction. This way also the 
hard-process scale is properly propagated for primordial <ei>kT</ei> 
sampling.</li> 
 
<li>The <code>stopMassNow</code> in 
<code>StringFragmentation.cc</code> is made to increase faster for 
charm and bottom end quarks, to allow an increased few-body fraction 
further above threshold. Thanks to Andy Buckley.</li> 
 
<li> Added <code>ResonanceDecayFilterHook</code> and example <code> 
main103.cc</code> to demonstrate how to select specific final states 
from resonance decays.</li> 
 
<li>Fixed vertex smearing in heavy ion events.</li> 
 
<li>Fixed remnant handling for e+e- collisions for photon-initiated 
processes, thanks to Murat Köksal.</li> 
 
<li>Several (mostly minor) optimisations in Vincia, thanks to 
D. Konstantinov.</li> 
 
<li>Minor fixes in xml/html QCD process links and text.</li> 
 
<li>Several small bug fixes based on error reports by Vittorio Zecca. 
<ul> 
<li>Fixed a bug where some elastic cross sections for pi K at low 
energies were set equal to the total ones.</li> 
<li>Protect against too high constituent masses inside a hadron in 
<code>LowEnergyProcess.cc</code>, already at an earlier stage of the 
process.</li> 
<li>Protect against <ei>exp(-infinity)</ei> in 
<code>HadronLevel.cc</code>.</li> 
<li>Two fixes for first step in the trial emissions in 
<code>StringFragmentation.cc</code>, used primarily in the thermal 
model option.</li> 
<li>Properly set the photon-in-lepton PDF to vanish at very large 
<ei>x</ei>, rather than give unphysical values there.</li> 
<li>Better protection against weird results for the <code>rap</code> 
and <code>eta</code> methods in <code>Basics.h</code>, and 
<code>y</code> in <code>Event.cc</code>.</li> 
<li>Fixed pointer logic in Dire <code>getXPDF</code>.</li> 
<li>Migrated from <code>log(1 + x)</code> to <code>log1p(x)</code> for 
numerical stability.</li> 
</ul> 
</li> 
 
<li>Several small fixes in response to a static code analysis, 
provided by Dmitri Konstantinov. 
<ul> 
<li>Fix inconsistency in the usage of the third argument of the 
<code>dsigmaEl</code> method in the classes derived from 
<code>SigmaTotAux</code>.</li> 
<li>Flawed and unused <code>LowEnergySigma::sigmaPartial</code> 
method removed.</li> 
<li>Fix inconsistent type for <code>varWidthIn</code> in 
<code>ParticleDataEntry</code> class.</li> 
<li>Introduce minor changes, e.g. to protect against out-of-bounds 
addressing or insert missing initializer, even though there is no 
evidence that it is needed.</li> 
<li>Small speedup of the <code>Vec4</code> <code>[]</code> operator 
using <code>switch()</code> instead of <code>if</code> to find element 
to be returned.</li> 
</ul> 
</li> 
 
<li>Bug fixed in the new possibility to let particles with narrow 
widths (such as onia states) obtain a simple Breit-Wigner 
distribution, specifically for MPIs, introduced in 8.240. This bug led 
to excessive rejection of low-invariant-mass interactions. Thanks to 
Albert De Roeck.</li> 
 
<li>Default event record checks switched off for 
<code>main21.cc</code>, to avoid issues with junction mother-daughter 
relations not being fully set. Also change so that showers are not 
called twice. Now all available cases are looped over, but easy to 
change back to study only one.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<h3>8.303: 01 September 2020</h3> 
 
<ul> 
<li>Marius Utheim and Leif Gellersen join the author team.</li> 
 
<li>A new framework for 
<aloc href="HadronicRescattering">Hadronic Rescattering</aloc> 
has been developed. To enable rescattering, use 
<code>HadronLevel:Rescatter = on</code>, or see 
<aloc href="SampleMainPrograms">example programs</aloc> 
<code>main151.cc</code> through <code>main156.cc</code> for use 
examples. Note that while the framework is ready to use, it is still 
being actively developed, and changes are likely in the near 
future. The older and much simpler rescattering models have been 
removed, including the related <ei>pp</ei> tunes 33 and 34, and there 
has been some file reorganization in code and documentation.</li> 
 
<li>A new class <aloc href="HadronWidths">HadronWidths</aloc> has been 
added to handle hadrons with mass-dependent widths. This has been done 
primarily because of its importance in resonance formation in 
rescattering, but the class is also used for decays of hadrons 
produced in other processes.</li> 
 
<li>A new class <code>LowEnergySigma</code> has been added to 
calculate cross sections of hadron-hadron interactions at low 
energies. These are used in rescattering and when performing primary 
collisions at low energies. Cross sections can be accessed using 
<code>Pythia::getLowEnergySigma</code>. 
</li> 
 
<li>Several changes in the <code>LowEnergyProcess</code> and 
<code>MiniStringFragmentation</code> frameworks, in particular with 
several new approaches to produce nondiffractive inelastic events as 
close as possible to the kinematical threshold. New method 
<code>StringFlav::combineToLightest</code> attempts to form the 
lightest hadron for a given flavour content. Also new possibility to 
disable popcorn baryon production, for use in small systems. 
</li> 
 
<li>The "decay"/mixing time of <ei>K^0/K^0bar &rarr; K^0_S/K^0_L</ei> 
has been changed from 1e-15 to 1e-6 mm, such that it only happens 
after hadronic rescattering, but still well before 
<ei>K^0_S/K^0_L</ei> decays.</li> 
 
<li>The <aloc href="PartonVertexInformation">Parton Vertex</aloc> 
impact-parameter-plane assignment machinery has been completely 
rewritten and expanded with new options and capabilities. The default 
proton radius has been change from 0.7 to 0.85 fm. 
</li> 
 
<li>Limit the amount by which transverse smearing of the space-time 
quark-antiquark string breakup vertices can give large shifts, see 
further the new <code>HadronVertex:maxSmear</code> parameter. The new 
<code>HadronVertex:maxTau</code> gives the possibility to reject 
hadrons of suspected misreconstructed systems and try again.  The 
introduction of MPI impact parameters is compensated by a reduced 
transverse hadronization smearing. Also some other related 
changes.</li> 
 
<li>The internal generation of photon-induced processes in hadronic 
collisions has been extended. This can be enabled with the new options 
<code>PDF:beamA2gamma</code> and <code>PDF:beamB2gamma</code>, which 
supersede the previous <code>PDF:leptonA2gamma</code> option. Some 
minor updates also for other related options, see 
<aloc href="PDFSelection">PDF Selection</aloc> for details. 
</li> 
 
<li>New photon fluxes from hadrons implemented, see 
<aloc href="PDFSelection">PDF Selection</aloc> for details. 
</li> 
 
<li>New example main program <code>main78.cc</code> to generate 
elastic, single- and double-dissociative photon-induced processes in 
proton-proton collisions, using options <code>PDF:beamA2gamma</code> 
and <code>PDF:beamB2gamma</code>. Also the sample programs 
<code>main69.cc</code> and <code>main70.cc</code> have been updated to 
use the new options. 
</li> 
 
<li>For asymmetric beams (e.g. electron-proton collisions) in Les 
Houches event files, a boost to the event CM frame is now defined and 
applied for outgoing particles, as required for succesful event 
processing. 
</li> 
 
<li>The problem of "dangling" gluons causing changing color flows in 
<code>SimpleTimeShower</code> for top decays is now fixed. The fix is 
not fully validated for RPV.</li> 
 
<li>For LHE processes, the width of the primordial kT distribution is 
now set solely by the <code>BeamRemnants:primordialKThard</code> 
parameter, ignorning <code>BeamRemnants:primordialKTsoft</code>.  This 
change is so that LHE events with low-pT extra jets (e.g., in the

<li>Fixed issue where the dark matter mass was reset even after 
explicitly being set by the user, <ei>e.g.</ei> <code>57:m0 = 
X</code>. This affects particle IDs 57 (<ei>DM+</ei>), 58 
(<ei>DM2</ei>), and 59 (<ei>DM++</ei>).</li> 
 
<li>An indexing bug for the scattering lepton in DIS events with 
photon radiation allowed has been fixed.</li> 
 
<li>The redefinition of <code>dlsym</code> for plugin loading has now

<ul> 
<li>In <code>ProcessContainer.cc</code> the error calculation for Les

<h3>8.302: 24 April 2020</h3> 
 
<ul> 
<li>A HepMC 3 interface is now included in 
<code>Pythia8Plugins/HepMC3.h</code>. All HepMC examples have been 
migrated from using the HepMC 2 interface to HepMC 3, excluding 
<code>main44.cc</code> and <code>main93.cc</code> which are kept for 
legacy purposes.</li> 
 
<li>Bug fix to correct units for automated shower uncertainty weights 
for <code>lhaStrategy = &plusmn;4</code>. In addition, the 
combination of weight variations, within the context of uncertainty 
bands, was not previously well documented and was therefore prone to 
misunderstandings. Now, all methods related to cross sections and 
weights are documented together on a single page, 
<aloc href="CrossSectionsAndWeights">Cross Sections and Weights</aloc>, the 
documentation on shower <aloc href="Variations">Variations</aloc> has 
been improved, and the behaviour of 
<code>Info::getGroupWeight()</code> has been made more transparent. 
The <code>main121.cc</code> example has been modified 
accordingly. Note that the bug fix for <code>lhaStrategy = 
&plusmn;4</code> parallels an analogous one made in Pythia 8.244 which 
had not been previously carried over to Pythia 8.3.</li> 
 
<li>Fix for subscripting issue for photon beams, courtesy of Vittorio 
Zecca.</li> 
 
<li>New particle property directive <code>tauCalc</code> allows for a 
particle's proper lifetime to be set independently of its width.  This 
is useful for studying the effect of lifetime for a particle when the 
particle width is otherwise negligible.</li> 
 
<li>Significant speedup of parton distribution handling, and 
thereby of the whole PYTHIA execution, since PDF is such a major 
part of the total execution time. This has been achieved by 
careful work by Dmitri Konstantinov and Grigory Latyshev. 
In detail, the main changes are: 
<ul> 
<li>In the LHAPDF6 interface the evaluation of the <ei>x</ei> and 
<ei>Q^2</ei> limits is extremely slow, such that a caching of these 
numbers increases execution speed by about a factor of 2 when LHAPDF 
is used.</li> 
<li>A caching of info on the amount of <ei>x</ei> already used up 
helps speed up MPI, ISR and FSR execution times, giving gains of 
order 20%. Main changes are in the <code>BeamParticle</code> class. 
</li> 
<li>Optimization of array handling in <code>LHAGrid1</code> give 
a speedup by about 5%. This is the internal PYTHIA implementation 
of interpolation in LHAPDF6 grids which, still after the LHAPDF6 
improvements reported above, runs more than 50% faster than using 
the same PDF evaluated by LHAPDF6. This streamlining is made at 
the cost of not offering facilities like PDF error bands.</li> 
<li>Also the special internal routines for the NNPDF 2.3 series 
could be speeded up, but would still be slower than an equivalent 
<code>LHAGrid1</code> implementation. The NNPDF 2.3 sets therefore 
have been moved to the latter framework.</li> 
</ul> 
</li> 
 
<li>New base class <code>ShowerModel</code> introduced, as a 
top-level handler of parton-shower models, interfaced via a shared 
pointer in <code>Pythia.cc</code>. 
Changes to Pythia's default showers 
and to the Vincia and Dire shower models to inherit from 
<code>ShowerModel</code>. New public method 
<code>Pythia::getShowerModelPtr()</code> intended to provide a way 
to access public ShowerModel methods for diagnostics purposes. 
</li> 
 
<li>Extra protection against unexpected input in <ei>e+e-</ei> Les 
Houches events, specifically where <ei>x >= 1</ei> by roundoff errors. 
Thanks to Alexander Belyaev, Alexander Pukhov and Marco Zaro.</li> 
 
<li>Bug fix in 
<code>SusyLesHouches::checkSpectrum()</code>, to ensure uniform 
error handling when one or more spectrum self-consistency checks fails. 
</li> 
 
<li>Replaced use of <code>fabs()</code> by <code>abs()</code> 
in several places. Although default C++ <code>abs()</code> only takes 
integer arguments, <code>PythiaStdLib.h</code> contains the 
declaration <code>using std::abs</code> (via the <code>cmath</code> 
header), which is suitably overloaded and obviates the need for 
separate methods. 
</li> 
 
<li>Improvements to Vincia's handling of error messages; 
now issued via <code>Info::errorMsg()</code>.</li> 
 
<li>Removed <code>share/Pythia8/tunes</code> directory, 
with Vincia reverting to the same (in-code) way of setting tune 
presets as Dire and Pythia.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<h3>8.301: 30 October 2019</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>Compilation is done with a new <code>-std=c++11</code> flag.</li> 
 
<li>The Vincia and Dire parton-shower programs, which previously have 
been available as free-standing add-ons to Pythia, are now fully 
integrated into Pythia, and will henceforth be distributed as part of 
this package. This has significant implications for code and 
documentation. The new master switch 
<code><aloc href="PartonShowers">PartonShowers:model</aloc></code> 
allows a simple choice of which to use, with 1 being the simple old 
internal one, 2 being Vincia and 3 being Dire. Note that Dire always 
comes with weighted events, while the other two by default have unit 
weight events, so analysis strategies must be adjusted accordingly. 
</li> 
 
<li>MadGraph-generated plugins for matrix element corrections to the 
Vincia and Dire parton-shower programs are now available. A new 
plugins directory has been created, where MadGraph5 matrix elements 
can be stored. Note that this implementation still is preliminary, 
with further improvements to come. To build the available plugins, 
<code>--enable-mg5mes</code> should be specified.</li> 
 
<li>Four new main programs have been introduced in the context of 
illustrating the Vincia and Dire shower models. Two of them also serve 
as examples of multithreading if Pythia is configured to link to 
OpenMP. <code>main200.cc</code> provides a simple test of final-state 
shower components, in a LEP-like setup. <code>main201.cc</code> 
compares two different shower models on dijet events. The two runs 
are executed in parallel if Pythia has been configured to link to 
OpenMP. <code>main202.cc</code> measures the running time for ttbar 
events and outputs a few test distributions. <code>main300.cc</code> 
can be linked against both HepMC2 and OpenMP, if Pythia has been 
configured correspondingly. It is capable of command-line 
instructions.</li> 
 
<li>A new plugin header, <code>Visualisation</code> is available and 
used in the example program <code>main300.cc</code>. Events can now be 
visualized via output that can be passed through GraphViz to produce a 
postscript file.</li> 
 
<li>Introduced a compromise for the treatment of lifetime and width, 
so that these can be set separately in some situations. If an 
<code>SLHA</code> file is used to set particle properties, then 
<code>SLHA:allowUserOverride = true</code> allows the lifetime to be 
set using a command file/string.  Otherwise, lifetime is calculated 
from particle width. The ability to have the width and lifetime as 
independent properties is convenient for studies of new physics.</li> 
 
<li>The HTML and XML versions of the manual have been significantly 
reordered, with contents grouped in an increased set of main headings, 
each with an expandable index of subheadings. There are several new 
sections, notably for the Vincia and Dire showers. Among other changes, 
the example main programs have been classified by keywords, and are 
listed and searchable by these, see 
<aloc href="ExampleKeywords">here</aloc>.</li> 
 
<li>The PHP version of the manual has been discontinued, since it 
would be difficult to maintain in conjuction with the ongoing expansion 
of the html manual. The <code>include/Pythia8/phpdoc</code> 
directory has been removed.</li> 
 
<li>The Python interface has been completely redesigned to handle 
<code>C++11</code> by migrating from a <code>SWIG</code> generated 
interface to a <code>PyBind11</code> one. It is now possible for 
users to generate their own interface. Full details are given on the 
<aloc href="PythonInterface">Python Interface</aloc> page.</li> 
 
<li>The field <code>Pythia::info</code> of type <code>Info</code> has 
been made a constant reference, so that it cannot be externally 
manipulated outside of the internal classes. This constant reference 
points back to <code>Pythia::infoPrivate</code> instance, which is 
for internal use only.  This instance now also contains pointers to 
several other commonly used classes.</li> 
 
<li>A new base class <code>PhysicsBase</code> has been created, from 
which several of the "physics" classes derive. This class standardizes 
the setup of pointers to commonly used classes, via the 
<code>Info</code> class. It has new methods that are called at the 
beginning and end of the generation of each event, and at the printout 
of final statistics. A new enum <code>Status</code> is provided in the 
method at the end of each event, to provide information on the reason 
for error exits. The access of the most commonly used 
<code>Settings</code> methods is streamlined.</li> 
 
<li>Most of the pointers in the <code>Pythia</code> class are now 
shared pointers, such that there is no need for <code>Pythia</code> to 
keep track of <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code> 
obligations. New header <code>SharedPointers.h</code>.</li> 
 
<li>The <code>CoupSM</code> and <code>CoupSUSY</code> couplings 
classes are now separated, rather than the latter being derived from 
the former.  This avoids the problem of the old <code>Couplings</code> 
pointer potentially changing address, and some pointer casting.</li> 
 
<li>Mathematical functions and methods have been extracted from the 
<code>PythiaStdlib.h/.cc</code> files and put in new 
<code>MathTools.h/.cc</code> files. Thereby <code>PythiaStdlib</code> 
is more clearly reserved for declarations related to the Stdlib 
library, to some simple inline expressions (now <code>constexpr</code> 
where feasible) and to an expanded list of conversion constants.</li> 
 
<li>A new method <code>Rndm::phaseSpace2</code> has been added, and can be 
used to sample two-body phase space.</li> 
 
<li>The heavy ion machinery has been fixed so that particle vertex 
information in the event record is stored in units of <em>mm</em> 
rather than <em>fm</em>, while internal calculations still are in 
<em>fm</em>. Thanks to Christopher Plumberg.</li> 
 
<li>The data files related to parton distributions have been moved to 
a new <code>share/pythia8/pdfdata</code> directory, and code has been 
changed accordingly.</li> 
 
<li>Iterators are made available to simplify the study of the particles 
in the event record.</li> 
 
<li>A bug in the XML-to-HTML conversion has led to the indiscriminate 
removal of "more" from the HTML manual, notably in 
<code>Pythia::moreDecays()</code>.</li> 
 
<li>New class <code>LowEnergyProcess</code> for the hadronization of 
low-energy collisions between two hadrons. By default there is a smooh 
transition between this simple nonperturbative model and the full 
MPI-based framework at higher energies. To be used e.g. within the 
modelling of hadronic rescattering in the final state of high-energy 
collisions.  This framework is still under development.</li> 
 
<li>New <code>StringInteractions</code> base class to provide common 
administrative framework for string shoving, rope hadronization, 
swing, (some) colour reconnection models, and more.</li> 
 
<li>The headers in <code>include/Pythia8Plugins</code> have been 
updated to no longer contain <code>using namespace Pythia8</code>. 
Thanks to Axel Naumann for pointing out inconsistent usage of scope. 
</li> 
 
<li>The build system has been updated to handle external package 
configuration scripts.</li> 
 
<li>The <code>ProMC</code> example and configuration option has been 
dropped.</li> 
 
<li>Optional package configurations for <code>RIVET</code> and 
<code>YODA</code> have been added.</li> 
 
<li>Support for <code>BOOST</code> has been dropped and only 
<code>LHAPDF6</code> with versions greater than <code>6.2</code> are 
supported.</li> 
 
<li>The flag <code>--openmp</code> has been added. Currently, OpenMP 
is used in some of the examples mentioned above, and in 
<code>DireWeightContainer.cc</code>.</li> 
 
<li>Bug fix so the option <code>UncertaintyBands:ISRpTmin2Fac</code> 
is correctly used in <code>SimpleSpaceShower.cc</code>.</li> 
 
<li>Bug fix stopping growth of number weights when multiple 
<code>init</code> calls are made in <code>Info</code>.</li> 
 
<li>Bug fix for <code>SusyWidthFunctions.cc</code> incorrectly calling 
<code>integrateGauss</code>, resulting in a width of zero.</li> 
 
<li>Bug fix to prevent overwriting of dark matter masses from unused 
model selections.</li> 
 
<li> Bug fix where instead of counting all PDG ids less than 100 as 
the Standard Model, masses of BSM Higges and dark matter are allowed 
to be set without changing minMassSM.</li> 
 
<li> All 2 to 2 SUSY processes now inherit from Sigma2SUSY.</li> 
 
<li>Bug fix for Les Houches Event File input without specified beams, 
such that multiparton decays of a resonance can be combined with 
showers, although with proper care needed so as not to doublecount 
emissions.</li> 
 
<li>Clarify that Q2 scale has to be set by hand for DIS processes, if 
so desired.</li> 
</ul>
