Plans/ideas for improvements to fjcontrib:
------------------------------------------

- scripts/update-contribs.sh ContribName
  has some option to list available versions
  
- some ability for contribs to require a minimal FJ version?

- get an fjcontrib-config script working

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Older/obsolete things
---------------------

For a first release

- check each contribution:
  
- release them

- decide/set version number of full contrib

- tools for checking content of release???


---------------------



- fjcontrib-config (--libs | ...) ???
  g++ `fjcontrib-config --cxxflags` 
  That could also hold version information

   overall package version: 0.001
   contribs:
    JetFFMoments      1.0.1
    GenericSubtractor trunk@revision

Questions:
----------
 - make-release.sh: do we want to check that we're in the trunk?


Mailing lists

  about it
