  NEWS: small tweaks to acknowledgments
2016-05-29  <jthaler>
  README/NEWS:  updated to include proper acknowledgments
  VariableRPlugin.cc:  updated comments
2016-03-29  Gregory Soyez  <soyez@fastjet.fr>
  Released version 1.2.0
2016-03-17  Gregory Soyez  <soyez@fastjet.fr>
  Preparing a 1.2.0-beta.1 release for testing purpose
2016-03-10  Gregory Soyez  <soyez@fastjet.fr>
  VariableRPlugin.cc: removed commented out code.
2016-03-09  <jthaler>
  VariableRPlugin.{hh,cc}:
     Fixed -Wgnu-static-float-init warning.  Small typos in comments fixed.
     Some commented out code removed in preparation for release.
  example.{cc,ref}:
     Change gen-kt example to p = -0.5 (since that is more physical)
  README:
     A bit more documentation added.
2016-03-09  Gregory Soyez  <soyez@fastjet.fr>
  VariableRPlugin.{hh,cc}:
     implemented as a gen-kt type of clustering. ClusterType is now
     defined as a double so one can pass any value with AKTLIKE,
     CALIKE and KTLIKE defined as -1, 0 and 1 respectively
  example.{cc,ref}: added an example using gen-kt(p=1/2)
2016-03-09  <jthaler>
   AUTHORS,example.cc,VariableR.hh,VariableRPlugin.{cc,hh}:
      Updated authorship/copyright information
2016-03-09  Gregory Soyez  <soyez@fastjet.fr>
   VariableRPlugin.{hh,cc}:
      issued a warning for deprecated pre-clustering
      best strategy now has a transition between N2Plain and N2Tiled
2016-03-08  <jthaler>
   example.cc,VariableR.hh,VariableRPlugin.{hh,cc}:
      Added fastjet authors to copyright statement
   AUTHORS:  Added fastjet authors to the list
   NEWS, README:  Fixed some typos
   VariableRPlugin.cc:
      Added "#" to timing test to avoid "make check" failing.
      Fixed error message to say that NNH is indeed supported in FJ<3.2.0
   example.cc:
      Adding in separate timing tests for the various strategies
2016-03-08  Gregory Soyez  <soyez@fastjet.fr>
   VariableRPlugin.{hh,cc}: adjusted a few details for compilation w FJ>3.2.0
   VariableRPlugin.{hh,cc}: added a "Best" strategy which selects a decent default
2016-03-07  Gregory Soyez  <soyez@fastjet.fr>
   example.{cc,ref}: prefixed the description line by "#" to avoid its
     inclusion in make check
   VariableRPlugin.{hh,cc}: For FastJet>=3.2.0, used the NNFJN2Tiled,
     NNFJN2Plain (and NNH) classes. The NNFJN2Tiled interface provides
     a much faster clustering than the native implementation.
     In practice, we introduced a "Strategy" class in VariableR that
     can take the following values: N2Tiled (the default if available),
     N2Plain, NNH or Native (the default for FastJet<3.2.0.
   VERSION: switched to 1.2.0-devel
