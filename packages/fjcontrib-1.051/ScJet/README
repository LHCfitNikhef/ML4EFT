The ScJet package implements a jet clustering algorithm based on a simple,
semi-classical model of a jet.  The algorithm is described in

Source files:
  ScJet.hh - header file for the implementation
  ScJet.cc - implementation (based on NNH)
  example.cc - simple usage example, also used for "make check"
