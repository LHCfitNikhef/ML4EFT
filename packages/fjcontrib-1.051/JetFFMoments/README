The JetFFMoments class allows one to calculate moments of jet
fragmentation functions and to subtract from them the effect of
background noise, as well as the effect of fluctuations, as described
in

The code example.cc illustrates the use of the class in a simple case.
It can be built using the included Makefile with the usual

    make example

example.cc makes use of an input datafile which is provided in the
../data directory, and it should be run with

   ./example < ../data/Pythia-Zp2jets-lhc-pileup-1ev.dat
 
The expected output can be found in example.ref
