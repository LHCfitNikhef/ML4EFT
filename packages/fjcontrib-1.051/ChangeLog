2014-01-31  Gavin SALAM  <salam@lpthe.jussieu.fr> + Gregory + Matteo

	* configure:
	* Makefile.in:
	added targets fragile-shared fragile-shared-install and fragile-shared-distclean;
	the fragile-shared(-install) builds (installs) a
	libfastjetcontribfragile.so file. This is currently very fragile, in 
	that it relies on just the SRCS formatting in the individual
	contrib makefiles (all sources on a single line, without wildcards).

2014-01-20  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* Makefile.in:
	* utils/check.sh: 

	arranged for make check to exit with error on failure from within
	subdirectories, but to exit OK on failure when called from the
	main directory (previous behaviour was to always exit OK).

	Removed redundant "exit 1" from the check.sh code (exit always
	handled by print_status_and_exit(...)).

	Also, when called directly from a subdirectory, make check no
	longer records its output in the test_summary.tmp file, and it now
	prints a colour-coded success/failure message.

2013-10-24  Gregory Soyez  <soyez@fastjet.fr>

	* scripts/internal/switch-to-version.sh:
	updated to add support for branches

	* scripts/update-contribs.sh (script_new_version):
	fixed an issue with checking out versions containing a '-' [the
	regular expression matching pattern was consifering these as
	"to-be-skipped"]

2013-10-21  Gavin Salam  <gavin.salam@cern.ch>

	* DEVEL-GUIDELINES:
	added some first thoughts on guidelines for reviewing

2013-09-24  Matteo Cacciari <cacciari@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

        * data/Pythia-Zp2jets-lhc-pileup-1ev.dat
        replaced with new file including also particle ID and charge.
        The events remain the same (up to, sometimes, differences in
        the last digit), the "make check" still work without changing
        the old reference files

2013-09-22  Matteo Cacciari <cacciari@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

        * utils/check.sh
        added a safety check to verify if tput is present on the system
        before using it to set colors

2013-09-19  Matteo Cacciari <cacciari@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

        * utils/check.sh
        added colors to Success/Failed output from "make check"

        * scripts/internal/generate-html-contents.pl 
        a flag can now be set to get an alphabetically ordered
        output (currently set to false, i.e. same output as before)

2013-09-19  Gregory Soyez  <soyez@fastjet.fr>

	* Makefile.in:
	* utils/check.sh:
	instead of having "make check" exit with an error whenever a test
	fails, let it keep going and print a summary of what has failed
	and succeded at the end of everything

2013-09-03  Matteo Cacciari <cacciari@lpthe.jussieu.fr>

          one contrib with the --only and --exclude options. The issues
          were a spurious "/" appearing in the replacement of commas with
          blanks in the contribs list, and a non-escaped command-line
          passed through sed when writing out the Makefile.

	* scripts/internal/release-fjcontrib.sh:
	hopefully fixed bug where tagging comment didn't have version

        * scripts/update-contribs.sh
	* scripts/internal/common.sh	
	* contribs.svn	
	replaced contribs.local with local_svn to avoid confusion with
	the name of the file that will eventually be used to contain
	local modifications to contribs.svn. 
	Fixed a regular expression in grep (allowing for mixture of spaces
	and tabs before the contrib name)
	Also reworded some comments.
	
	Added support for a contribs.local overriding default entries in
	contribs.svn. Added option to skip processing of a specific 
	contribution by scripts/update-contribs.sh, by replacing version
	number with any number of dashes.
