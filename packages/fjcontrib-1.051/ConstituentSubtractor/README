ConstituentSubtractor is part of the fastjet-contrib project.

The ConstituentSubtractor class corrects jets for background contamination at particle-level as described in

   Particle-level pileup subtraction for jets and jet shapes

   arXiv:1403.3108

The code example.cc illustrates how to use the class on individual jets.
It can be built using

    make example

example.cc makes use of an input datafile which is provided in the
/data directory, and it should be run with

   ./example < ../data/Pythia-Zp2jets-lhc-pileup-1ev.dat
 
The expected output can be found in example.ref


The code example_whole_event.cc illustrates how to use the class on the whole event - before jet clustering.
It can be built using

    make example_whole_event

example_whole_event.cc makes use of an input datafile which is provided in the
/data directory, and it should be run with

   ./example_whole_event < ../data/Pythia-Zp2jets-lhc-pileup-1ev.dat
 
The expected output can be found in example_whole_event.ref
