Unbinned multivariate observables for global SMEFT analyses from machine learning
===================================================================================


The ML4EFT code is used in the following publication:

- *Unbinned multivariate observables for global SMEFT analyses from machine learning*, Raquel Gomez Ambrosio, Jaco ter Hoeve, Maeve Madigan, Juan Rojo and Veronica Sanz :cite:`ML4EFT_temp_id`

We present the results of this paper here, including additional plots and animations not present in the paper, 
as well as links to the trained neural networks and associated training reports.

The results are divided into three sections, corresponding to the three physical processes under consideration: parton level top pair production,
particle level top pair production in the dilepton channel and Higgs production in association with a Z boson in the :math:`\ell^{+} \ell^{-} b \bar{b}` final state.
