Kinematic features used as Inputs to the Neural Network
============================================================

In the case of particle-level top quark events in the dilepton channel,

.. math::

        p p \rightarrow t \bar{t}, t \bar{t} \rightarrow b \bar{b} \ell^{+} \ell^{-} \nu_{\ell} \bar{\nu}_{\ell} \, ,

one has access to
a much larger set of final state kinematical features.  

We display here the kinematical features used as inputs to the neural network, 
calculated both in the SM and at representative points in the SMEFT parameter space.
Both linear and quadratic contributions from the SMEFT operators are included.
