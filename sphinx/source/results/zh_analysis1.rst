Kinematic features used as inputs to the neural network
============================================================

We display here the kinematical features used as inputs to the neural network,
calculated both in the SM and at representative points in the SMEFT parameter space.

First, we display the results including only linear contributions from the SMEFT Wilson coefficients:

Secondly, we include both linear and quadratic contributions:
